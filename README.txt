This program will run the edmonds karp algorithm from a file that will be inputted by the user.
When the program is executed, the user will be prompted for a filename of a graph with weighted 
edges, and then promped to enter the source and sink nodes of the graph. Once entered, the program 
will run the algorithm, printing the path of the shortest bfs run on each iteration, and finally 
will print the maximum flow of the graph.

To run this program on siue servers:
g++ 'EdmondsKarp'
./a.out
